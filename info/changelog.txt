  --  Adds the ability to define and use a huffman encoding for compression of data.
  
  --  Has encryption tools to create an encrypted input and output stream.

V-0.1.1: Bigger Security Update
Released: 02/28/2016
**Libraries**
GMathv0.4.1
GCorev0.1.6

  --  Moved the number theory operations to the gmath library.
  
  --  Added multiply bit encryption so you can specify how secure your encryption is by how many bits
      you use.
      
  --  Encryption amounts can differ between client and server so each user can specify how secure they want
      their end to be.
      
  --  The amount specified is actually the amount the other person sends to you so if you want what you
      are sending to be secure you need the other person to specify a higher security.

Released: 03/03/2016
**Libraries**
GMathv0.4.1
GCorev0.1.6
GFilesv0.1.0

  --  Added a simple file encryption utility for encrypting/ decrypting files.
